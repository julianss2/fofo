    <p id="inf1">informations about Firmino</p>

    <div>
      <p id="myPara">
        At Hoffenheim, Firmino primarily played as an attacking midfielder,[92]
        or as a second striker, but was also used as a forward, winger or
        central midfielder, with Firmino using his speed, close control and
        vision wherever he is deployed.[93][94] After initially starting as a
        left winger at Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers, new manager Jürgen Klopp
        used Firmino more centrally, initially as a False 9.[95] However, after
        impressing under Klopp's pressing system, Firmino established himself as
        Liverpool's first choice centre-forward by the 2017–18 season.[96] Ian
        Doyle of the Liverpool Echo referred to him as "a true Liverpool number
        nine", whose "numbers are up there with Harry Kane and Sergio
        Agüero."[97] Ryan Babel, a teammate of Firmino's at Hoffenheim,
        described him as "A tricky <br />
        He can dribble, shoot, he has a great shot, he can play a lot of through
        balls and his assists are very good", while also praising a heading
        ability which would not be common amongst other players of Firmino's
        slender build and relatively small stature,[23] a unique trait which
        journalist and ESPN contributor Michael Cox has also noted.[98] Babel
        also stated that Firmino had a humble mentality and no problems with
        attitude.[23] Manager Hemerson Maria also stated that he was impressed
        with Firmino's "strong personality and mentality."[99] In addition to
        his technical skills, creativity, link-up play, and goalscoring, Firmino
        has also been praised by his managers, teammates, and pundits for his
        positional sense, mobility, intelligent movement, and ability to make
        attacking runs off the ball, which often draws opposing players out of
        position and creates space for his teammates.[98][100][101][102][103]
